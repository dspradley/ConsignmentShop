# ConsignmentShop
This is a intro program in C# based of a YT channel (IAmTimCorey).

Program will pull up a userinterface for a user to select specific books to be purchased. This will then take these books out of the stores inventory
(in a collection) and do any necessary math calulcations for venders. Vendors are assigned commision and a profit is added to their accounts.
Will track if books have been sold and their price to user. 
Fairly basic at the moment but is a good introduction in C# syntax.
